2.4
The totalSentiment() method converts the contents of the parameter 'fileName' into text using the method textToString(). 
It then splits the resulting text by spaces and stores it in the String array 'words'.
It then iterates through the array, taking out punctuation, if any, using the method removePunctuation() and calculates the sentiment value of that word using the method sentimentVal().
It then adds that to a current 'totalSentiment' tracker.
After iteration is complete, it returns 'totalSentiment'.
