time spent:  2 hrs (1 on weekend, 1 on Monday)

DISCO
 - Interfaces are italicized on the API
QCC
 - WHY DO THEY SUCK AT SPACING?? Number 1, why put any spacing at all in a file name. Number 2, WHY PUT TWO SPACES BETWEEN WORDS??? EVER??
 - Assertions seem really (REALLY) similar to if statements... you start to wonder what's the point?
 - Why would assertions be disabled by default (-JM)?? Could it be like a testing mode/debug mode (-BB)?

Activity 2:

Questions:
1. Explain in your own words the relationship between a deck and a card.
A: The deck class contains lists that are filled by cards.

2. Consider the deck initialized with the statements below. How many cards does the deck contain?
String[] ranks = {"jack", "queen", "king"};
String[] suits = {"blue", "red"};
int[] pointValues = {11, 12, 13};
A: The deck contains six cards.

Deck d = new Deck(ranks, suits, pointValues);
3. The game of Twenty-One is played with a deck of 52 cards. Ranks run from ace (highest) down to 2
(lowest). Suits are spades, hearts, diamonds, and clubs as in many other games. A face card has point
value 10; an ace has point value 11; point values for 2, ..., 10 are 2, ..., 10, respectively. Specify the
contents of the ranks, suits, and pointValues arrays so that the statement
Deck d = new Deck(ranks, suits, pointValues);
initializes a deck for a Twenty-One game.
A: Ranks would contain every rank from ace to two, running in decreasing order (standard deck of cards). Suits
would contain hearts, clubs, spades, and diamonds. pointValues would contain 11, 10, and then every number from 9 to
1, IN DECREASING ORDER.
4. Does the order of elements of the ranks, suits, and pointValues arrays matter?
A: The order of ranks and suits does not matter as we create every possible combination. The order of pointValues matters
because we assign them one to one to the ranks value.

Activity 5:
  Buggy 1:
    isEmpty doesn't work properly
  Buggy 2:
    size doesn't update properly
  Buggy 3:
    match doesn't work properly
  Buggy 4:
    Deck doesn't set cards properly
  Buggy 5:
    shuffle doesn't function - the for loop printing items goes lower than index 0
    isEmpty doesn't account for size == 0
    constructor starts at index 1 instead of 0
    should check empty before decrementing size in deal
