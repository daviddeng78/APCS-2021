Ruawatrain's CSV FLOW:
04-06 -- Salaj helped a lot in doing the CSV stuffs. We essentially found a CSV on Kaggle, downloaded it... and did it??
Originally there were some issues in converting Strings to ints, however we skipped this by leaving the data as Strings and only converting to ints when we wanted to use it.
Additionally, ints couldn't fit the 2,100,000 dollar home, so we ended up using longs.
The main issues were in that some of the cost sections were -, and also tax evasion plots. Thus, we ignored any price with less than 3 characters.

TRUBZ
Converting String to int
Using long instead of int
Salaj helped with most of the trubz.
