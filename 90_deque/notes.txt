DISCO
Nearly every method in Deque appears in LinkedList, making pass through functionality very VERY easy
What we thought would be hard turned out to be very easy bc of above disco, thus our readme file isn't SUPER accurate.

QCC
Why were there so many seemingly redundant methods in the Deque interface??
