DISCO
0. Java compiles the inner class as `LList$MyIterator.class`.
1. $ is typed in the terminal with \$

QCC
0. WHATZ UP WITH `LList.this.remove()`? We understand LList.remove() but why is `this` necessary? Why does it clear up
```
              LList.java:301: error: non-static method remove(int) cannot be referenced from a static context
                    LList.remove(index); // why is this required?
                         ^
              where T is a type-variable:
                T extends Object declared in class LList
              1 error
```
1. How could/can we ensure all elements were removed without the use of an extra instance variable?
EDIT QCC 1 was resolved after an excellent suggestion by TSR
