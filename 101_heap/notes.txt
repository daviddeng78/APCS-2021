HW101 --  Heap o'Trouble
2022-05-16
time spent: .7 hrs

DISCO
0. Insertion and removal are pretty similar to that of BST (but remove is more different)

QCC
0. Remove was harder than we thought (TJM thought the algo was scummy because it just adds the elements in one at a time which kinda sucks)
1. We still don't like heap :(
2. WHAT IS IT GOOD FOOOOOR :(((( Its sort of ok for returning the minimum of a dataset... but we could just run a min check instead of... this

TRF's LCT (very useful, for personal note purposes)

A HEAP is a rooted tree satisfying the heap property:
   If A is a parent node of B then A's key is ordered with B's key (with same ordering applying across the tree)
There are two flavors of heaps: min heaps and max heaps:
   A min heap maintains the heap invarient that all of the children of any node are greater than the parent node.
   A max heap maintains the heap invarient that all of the children of any node are less than the parent node.

//min heap example:                   //max heap example:
    3                                      57
   / \                                    / \
  5   7                                  36 45
 / \   \                                /   / \
