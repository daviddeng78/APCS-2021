With L = level, d = depth, h = height
h+d is constant? h+L is constant?? (not totally sure)

1. a perfect binary tree has 2^(h+1)-1 nodes from the root.
2. at each level, a perfect binary tree has 2^d nodes
3. height of a complete binary tree w/ n nodes is roughly floor(log2(n)).
   We dedicate one node to be the root, and split the remaining n-1 nodes roughly equally between the left and right
   Thus the final height is how many splits we make in total, which is a bit less than log2(n)
