DISCO
0. In the end when it finally worked it was wonderful, but felt like crying along the way.
1. Better understanding of pointers was achieved through lots of time, blood, sweat, and tears.
QCC
0. HOLY CRAP THIS WAS HARD.
1. I feel like we should have had a better plan, but at the same time I don't think there was much we could have done differently.
2. We honestly thought we understood the process quite well but when coding we hit so many tiny little errors (specifically with pointers) that it took a long time.
3. Our code grew unweildly the more bugs we hit.
4. Pointers are still confusing.
